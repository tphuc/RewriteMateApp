Have you ever been in the middle of writing an email and thought, "This sounds kinda off"?

You copy it, jump over to ChatGPT, wait for a better version, then paste it back. And honestly, that little dance happens a ton—Slack messages, quick notes, texts that just don't feel right. All those tiny interruptions really add up.

What if the AI just came to you, right where you're typing? No switching apps, no extra steps.

That's what RewriteMate is all about—a super simple app for your Mac, iPhone, or iPad that helps you rewrite stuff on the spot.

Most AI writing tools make you open a new tab or visit a website. ChatGPT is awesome, but it pulls you out of what you're doing. Grammarly mostly sticks to browsers. QuillBot? You've gotta paste everything into their site.

RewriteMate is different. It's made just for Apple devices, so it works *everywhere* you type—no web needed.

### On your Mac
It works in any app with a quick keyboard shortcut.  
Select your text, hit the shortcut, and boom—better version appears right there. No copying, no pasting.

### On iPhone or iPad
It's a keyboard you can switch to anytime.  
Writing a text, email, or note? Highlight it, tap an option, and make it friendlier, shorter, or clearer before you hit send.

You can even create your own quick buttons, like "make this sound nicer" or "keep it short and sweet."

It's perfect for those everyday moments:
- Emails that came out too blunt (soften them up a bit)
- Rambling Slack messages (tighten them into one clear line)
- Messy quick notes
- Texts that autocorrect totally wrecked
- Writing in English when it's not your first language

### How it stacks up
- Way handier than Grammarly for fast rewrites anywhere (not just grammar checks)
- Much quicker than ChatGPT—no copy-paste shuffle
- No back-and-forth like QuillBot
- Built for little tweaks, not huge editing sessions

It's simple on purpose. No complicated menus or settings. Just download it and use it when you need.

If you like apps that feel right at home on your Apple stuff and hate extra hassle, you might really like this one.

Give it a try on the App Store:

Better words, right where you're already writing. 😊
