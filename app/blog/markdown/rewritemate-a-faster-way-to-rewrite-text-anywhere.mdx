You're typing an email. You read it back. Something feels weird.
So you copy it, open ChatGPT, paste it in and wait for it to fix, then paste it back.

Sound familiar?
This happens all the time. Slack messages, quick notes... texts that just don't sound right. And every time, you lose focus.
What if the AI just showed up right where you're typing?
No app switching. No extra clicks. Just help, right when you need it.
That's RewriteMate. It's a simple app for your Mac, iPhone, or iPad that rewrites stuff instantly.
Here's the thing:

**ChatGPT is great, but it takes you away from your work**

RewriteMate is different.
It's built just for Apple devices. That means it works everywhere you type: email, messages, notes, anywhere. No website needed.

### On your Mac
It works in any app with a quick keyboard shortcut.  
Select your text, hit the shortcut, and boom—better version appears right there. No copying, no pasting.

### On iPhone or iPad
It's a keyboard you can switch to anytime.  
Writing a text, email, or note? Highlight it, tap an option, and make it friendlier, shorter, or clearer before you hit send.

You can even create your own quick buttons, like "make this sound nicer" or "keep it short and sweet."

It's perfect for those everyday moments:
- Emails that came out too blunt (soften them up a bit)
- Rambling Slack messages (tighten them into one clear line)
- Messy quick notes
- Texts that autocorrect totally wrecked
- Writing in English when it's not your first language

### How it stacks up
- Way handier than Grammarly for fast rewrites anywhere (not just grammar checks)
- Much quicker than ChatGPT—no copy-paste shuffle
- No back-and-forth like QuillBot
- Built for little tweaks, not huge editing sessions

It's simple on purpose. No complicated menus or settings. Just download it and use it when you need.

If you like apps that feel right at home on your Apple stuff and hate extra hassle, you might really like this one.



Give it a try on the App Store:

Better words, right where you're already writing. 😊
