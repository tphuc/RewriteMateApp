        question: "What is RewriteMate?",
        answer: `RewriteMate is the better writing tool for macOS — built to help you instantly improve, rephrase, and refine any text across your system.
        It works everywhere on your Mac, letting you rewrite text from Notes, Mail, Safari, or any app without switching windows.`,
      },
    {
      id: "data",
      question: "Are my text or data stored?",
      answer: `No — RewriteMate follows a non-data-retention policy.
      Your text is never stored, logged in our server.
      Requests are securely processed through trusted AI providers via our proxy, 
      and we only store your email and rewrite usage to manage subscriptions.`,
    },
    {
      id: "byok",
      question: "What is the BYOK plan?",
      answer: `BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) lets you connect your own API key from a supported AI provider.
      In this mode, your requests go directly from your Mac to the provider servers. No traffic or text passes through our infrastructure.`,
    },
    {
      id: "offline",
      question: "Does RewriteMate work offline?",
      answer: `RewriteMate requires an internet connection to communicate with AI models.
      However, all processing is lightweight and fast, and no data is stored after your rewrite is complete.`,
    },
    {
      id: "custom-prompts",
      question: "What are Custom Instructions?",
      answer: `Custom Instructions let you define how RewriteMate rewrites.
      You can create your own presets.`
    },
    {
      id: "plans",
      question: "Is there a free plan?",
      answer: `Yes! RewriteMate includes a free tier with limited rewrites each month.
      Upgrade to the Pro plan for higher limits and faster performance.`,
    },
